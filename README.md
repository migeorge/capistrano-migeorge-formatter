# Capistrano MiGeorge Formatter

Custom formatter for Capistrano 3, with compact output, and opinionated according to my own needs.

I don't like the built-in formatters from sshkit. They're too verbose in debug mode, but too little verbose otherwise. Everytime an error occurred while using `set :debug, :info`, I would find myself changing it back to `:debug` to see the actual error messages.

A quick breakdown of what it does:

* no difference for each log level. I might add this in the future, but at this point, I didn't feel the need;
* each command is printed in a single line, containing a trimmed message and a success flag;
* if a command has output in stdout/stderr, it will be printed below, with a leading tab, in green/red respectively;
* conditional commands (i.e. commands with the format `[ some_bash_condition ]`) will not be printed. They frequently return false, which would output a red failure flag. I find that misleading, since it doesn't mean the deploy failed, it's merely a condition that evaluated to false.

Sample output:
